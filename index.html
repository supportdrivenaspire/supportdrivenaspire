                        of my career, and ultimately led me to find a new role that better fit my career goals.

                    <p>
                        Having a third party mentor allowed me to be really candid about what I wanted, and gave me a
                        great resource for professional advice.”

                        I can’t wait to do this again, although I think my mentee and I will probably continue to advise each other informally for some time to come.”
